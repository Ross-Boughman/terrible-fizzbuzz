# Terrible-FizzBuzz

## Description

Have you ever written a FizzBuzz? Have you done it efficiently, in one line? Something like `for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) console.log((i % 3 ? "" : "Fizz") + (i % 5 ? "" : "Buzz") || i);`? Why do it so well!? What are you, a nerd?

Sarcasm aside, (yes we're all nerds) I had heard someone ask once how you would go about making the worst FizzBuzz you could think of, while still making it work in the end. I figured I'd give it a shot. 

This particular version uses fs.writefile to create a new fizzBuzz.js file, then automatically runs it with a child process that runs `node fizzBuzz.js`.

## Installation

To install this (why?) simply clone the repo to your computer, then enter `node index.js` into the terminal at the location. It will require that you have node installed on your machine.
